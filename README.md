# NFT_Sale-ERC721A

This is a functional and scalable nft contract implementing Azuki's ERC721A. https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A

This contract has public sale, whitelist sale, and owner mint features. Test it out in remix and adjust to your specs. 

I have commented on essentially every line of code and provided resources for further information within those comments.

I recommend using solidity compiler 0.8.4
